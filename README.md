# Universe Engine

A star renderer. Currently has the nearest ~2.4 million stars, sourced from [ATHYG catalogue](https://www.astronexus.com/hyg). Objects are stored in an octree, and distant collections of stars are approximated as a point light. Theoretically, a far larger area than the ~10000ly shown could be shown without minimal performance impact.

Still to do:
- Galaxies
- Procedural Generation
